I am an experienced Security Researcher specialized in Reverse Engineering, Penetration Testing, and Vulnerability Research. I apply an attacker mindset and offensive security expertise to find and fix the critical vulnerabilities others miss.

This site serves as a public archive of security vulnerabilities I have discovered and reported.
